# WebScraper 
This is a webscraper working in a django web application.
Basically i used Beautiful Soup and Requests to scrape the Kenyan Online shops and retrieve the prices of the products passed through a web form and graph the comparison data in a pie chart.
The user can also get the pdf copy of the graphing by downloading it.
The sites scraped are
 [Jumia](https://www.jumia.co.ke)
 [Killmall](https://www.kilimall.co.ke)
 [Avechi](https://avechi.com/)
 I 'am working on future developments on the project
